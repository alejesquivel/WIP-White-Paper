# WIP-White-Paper
This is a white paper with sample code extracts for a blockchain DApp project.

The white paper will be diagnosing a pivotal problem that multiple firms face: the breakdown between biz and IT. As the old addage goes (traditionally for marriage but bear with me) "can't live with them, can't live without them." 

In this white paper I will be using a firm known as ABC Corporation (ABC) that faces a problem. The problem being: the business department and IT department have disdain for each other. ABC corporation is a data solutions provider. ABC sells cloud storage, migration services, support services, and consulting. In the business department's defense - they require a fairly technical understanding in order to properly develop a strategy for their clients. However, in the technology department's eyes - they do not know enough. 

Technology is a perfect way for firms to continue scaling by automating and mitigating mundane and redundant tasks, allowing for work on the business vs working IN the business. 

The barrier that exists between these crucial units boils down to three main pillars: 
  1. Language. In ABC's sales department, the associates talk about ARR, quotas, SAAS, growth... The tech team thinks those are all marketing ploys.

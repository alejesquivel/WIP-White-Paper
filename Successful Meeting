Clear objective: what is the end result? What value will be added through this meeting? 
Who do you invite: Who NEEDS to be on the meeting? Will it possibly hurt the overall progress if someone were left off/ added? 
Schedule: Put out a rough agenda; no need to follow to a tee but be sure that there is understanding of the flow/ direction for this meeting
Allow everyone to voice at all points in the meeting: ask someone to speak up who hasn't said much, ask for the more vocal to tone down to allow for others to vocalize
Follow up email: over detailing is usually not a bad thing... make sure to highlight the key takeaways and emphasize any action to be taken as a result of the meeting
